    Our Vision :
</h3>
<p>
    This programme focuses on some of the disruptive innovations that the last decade has been witnessed to, namely, Internet of Things (IoT), Robotics, Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing), Industrial Automation, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, etc. These technologies have a huge potential to shape the future of mankind. Smart manufacturing, being an important aspect of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is the next industrial revolution. Smart manufacturing integrates data and information from multiple open and vendor applications and products to form new solutions. It can be applied to a single machine line, an entire factory or across a network of manufacturers, suppliers and customers. This new area of innovation will optimize the entire manufacturing industry to create higher quality products at lower prices, improve productivity, increase energy efficiency, and sustain safer plants.
